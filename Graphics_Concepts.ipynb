    "<p>OpenGL is an API specification which indicates what certain functions and classes should do. This is organized by the Khronos group. A collection of developers specifying the latest graphics programming API. It is up to the graphics card sellers to create OpenGL implementations. These implementations can be created by anybody and often have names. Typically people just refer to it as \"OpenGL\". The fact that OpenGL works on most video cards is because these functions are the same. Basically the API makes it possible to work accross cards.</p>"

    "<b>OpenGL State Machine</b>: OpenGL is by itself a large state machine: basically a status of a pre-existing machine with a collection of variables which define how OpenGL should operate. We often change the state by setting some options, manipulating some buffers then render using the current state.<br>\n",
    "<b>OpenGL Context</b>: The current state at one moment is called the context. As opposed to the constantly changing state of OpenGL.<br>\n",
    "<b>OpenGL Object</b>: A struct with a list of properties inside of it. These essentially annotate groups/collections of options representing a subset of OpenGL's state.<br>\n"
